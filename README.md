# Random german vocab 

This a random program I made only for fun - to brush up on my deutsch. It is inspired by the Mogoosh app for GRE vocabulary practice, where you get asked meanings of random words from a huge vocabulary list. Upon running the main.py file, you'll be asked the meaning of basic german words, and scored accordingly. Currently, this is a very basic version of the program, I plan to expand the vocabulary list and incorporate sentences as examples for most of the words as well.

The words are taken from the following link: https://www.ocr.org.uk/images/68532-vocabulary-list-by-topic.pdf
