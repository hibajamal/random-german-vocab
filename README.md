# Random german vocab 

This a random program I made only for fun - to brush up on my deutsch. It is inspired by the Mogoosh app for GRE vocabulary practice. Upon running the main.py file, you'll be asked the meaning of basic german words. Currently, this is a very basic version of the program, I plan to incorporate sentences as examples for each of the words as well.

The words are taken from the following link: https://www.ocr.org.uk/images/68532-vocabulary-list-by-topic.pdf
